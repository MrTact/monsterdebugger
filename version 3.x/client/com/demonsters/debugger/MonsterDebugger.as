/**
 * 
 * This is the client code that needs to be implemented into a 
 * Flash, FLEX or AIR application to collect debug information 
 * in De Monster Debugger. 
 * 
 * Be aware that any traces made to De Monster Debugger may 
 * be viewed by others. De MonsterDebugger is intended to be 
 * used to debug Flash, FLEX or AIR applications in a protective
 * environment that they will not be used in the final launch. 
 * Please make sure that you do not send any debug material to
 * the debugger from a live running application. 
 * 
 * Use at your own risk.

		 * The trace function of the Monster Debugger can be used to display standard objects like

		 * custom classes, XML or even multidimensional arrays containing XML nodes for that matter. 
		 * It will send a snapshot of those objects to the desktop application where you can inspect them. 
		 * 
		 * @example
		 * <code>
		 * MonsterDebugger.trace(this, "error");<br>
		 * MonsterDebugger.trace(this, myObject);<br>
		 * MonsterDebugger.trace(this, myObject, "joe", "myLabel");<br>

		 * 							The caller is displayed in the desktop application to easily identify 
		 * 							your traces on instance level. Note: if you use this function within a 
		 * 							static class, use a string as caller like: "MyStaticClass".
		 * @param object: 			The object to trace, this can be anything. For instance a String, 
		 * 							Number or Array but also complex items like a custom class, 
		 * 							multidimensional arrays.
		 * @param person: 			(Optional) The person of interest. You can use this label to easily 
		 * 							work with a team of programmers on one project. The desktop application 
		 * 							has a filter for persons so each member can see their own traces.
		 * @param label: 			(Optional) Label to identify the trace. Within the desktop application
		 * 							you can filter on this label.
		 * @param color: 			(Optional) The color of the trace. This can be useful if you want 
		 * 							to color code your traces; red for errors, green for status updates, etc.
		 * @param depth: 			(Optional) The level of depth for this trace. By default the Monster Debugger 
		 * 							will trace a tree structure of five levels deep to preserve CPU power. 
		 * 							In some occasions 5 could not be enough to see the whole object, for 
		 * 							instance if you’re tracing a large XML document with many sub nodes. 
		 * 							In those situations you can use a higher number to see the complete object. 
		 * 							If you set the depth to -1 it will not limit the levels at all and will 
		 * 							trace the entire tree. Be careful with this setting though as it can 
		 * 							dramatically slow down your application.
