/**
 * 
 * This is the client code that needs to be implemented into a 
 * Flash, FLEX or AIR application to collect debug information 
 * in De Monster Debugger. 
 * 
 * Be aware that any traces made to De Monster Debugger may 
 * be viewed by others. De MonsterDebugger is intended to be 
 * used to debug Flash, FLEX or AIR applications in a protective
 * environment that they will not be used in the final launch. 
 * Please make sure that you do not send any debug material to
 * the debugger from a live running application. 
 * 
 * Use at your own risk.
